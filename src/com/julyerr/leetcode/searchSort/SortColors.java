/**
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue,
 * searchSort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
 * <p>
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * You are not suppose to use the library's searchSort function for this problem.
 * <p>
 * click to show follow up.
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting searchSort.
 * First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
 * <p>
 * Could you come up with an one0327-pass algorithm using only constant space?
